  <li>  The lowest number ball must be struck first or it is a foul.</li>
  <li>  Any foul ends the current rack you are playing.</li>
  <li>  If you make a good hit and scratch, then all balls made with that hit will be counted.</li>
  <li>  Immediately after the break you have two options: <br>
    a.) Play the cue ball from where it lies with no penalty - OR - <br>
    b.) Take ball in hand and take a 2 point penalty.</li>
  <li> If you scratch on the break you must shoot from behind the scratch line
      and it is a 2 point penalty. If the object ball you are shooting at is behind
      this line then you must shoot past the line and come back to hit it.
      If any part of the ball is touching the scratch line then it is considered behind the line.</li>
